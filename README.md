**easy password manager** *(epm)* is an easy tool to manage your passwords

it is inspired by the best parts of [pass](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pass), but keeping it even more minimal, so that the user cannot ever shoot himself in the foot

improvements over [pass](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pass) are:

1) you cannot ever delete an entry. not only you cannot execute a "rm" command over a password, but you will not be able, with the use of the scripts, to delete any password whatsoever. they will be moved and can only be deleted with manual intervention. i once was experimenting with [pass](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pass), and run the "init" command, and almost lost all my passwords due to the stupid reencryption. a "convinient" thing if you want to change your key, but not if you don't want to. if you want to change your key, you will have to start over, it's not epm's job
2) small and easy. we use [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) for the keys, which generates a key file file of approximately 189 bytes. nothing to do with bloated [gpgme](https://gnupg.org/software/gpgme/index.html) that you have to handle yourself and is painful
